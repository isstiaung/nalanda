## [Unreleased]

<!-- Each pull request adds its entries here (### Added, ### Changed, ### Fixed, and ### Upgrading
for what a host must do; link runbooks as ../runbooks/…); a release commit renames this file to vX.Y.Z.md and starts a fresh one (ARCH.md §16 #42). -->

### Added
- **A static demo.** `npm run demo:build` seeds a scratch instance and crawls it into plain HTML — every page a member sees, links intact, every form answered with "read-only demo", a few canned searches, no service worker, a banner — behind a sign-in that accepts `demo` / `demo` in the browser and says it isn't security. A workflow publishes it to GitHub Pages on each release ([runbooks/demo.md](../runbooks/demo.md)). Nothing in the app changes.
